**Happy to have you here!**  
I am an epidemiologist with a passion for data science. In my current role, I utilize RStudio, Tableau, SQL, and SAS to gain insight into the world of communicable diseases. I enjoy learning new programs and taking on creative projects. I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to share my passion for coding with fellow programmers through weekly lessons I provide to coworkers. Check out my teaching repository for some sample code from those lessons!
